Star Wars Films with Vue 3

API: https://swapi.dev/api/films

The app has to display a list of all the star wars movies served by the API endpoint. For each movie you have to show the poster, title, introductory text (opening crawl), director, year, number of characters, number of ships, number of vehicles and amount of spices.
